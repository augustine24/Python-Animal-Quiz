# Python-Animal-Quiz
An animal trivia quiz that shows questionnaire prowess, the purpose of this repository is to show the reader how to make a succession of interactive questions and answers in yes/no or true/false format in the python coding language. This is relatively fast to make and despite not knowing what is going on the code, if one runs the code in https://www.online-python.com/online_python_compiler by copy and pasting all of it's content, then the result is that the interaction between user and AI(Artificial Intelligence) starts, and the quiz proceeds. 

This assignment was a little tricky, and more than anything I wanted a way to make the flow of questions smooth. Because of that I imported the python time package and also had to alter the answer variable over and over along with the flow of the questions. It was short to make but also fun.
I hope you can enjoy what I've produced. I plan to add more questions to make the quiz more interesting.

I found that the code I used was very repetitive and I am contemplating ways to make it shorter and more efficient by employing more variables and perhaps defining functions, but so far I'm comfortable for the most part with how the quiz I made looks.
Thank you for reading.
